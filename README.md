Description:
This is an assignment in which I took a mock website and cleaned up the HTML and CSS to be cleaner and easier for developers to view. This involved replacing a handful of divs with semantic elements, adding alt attributes for accessibility, and plenty more.

Usage:
To utilize my assignment, you may view it from my github repository.
